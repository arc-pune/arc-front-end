# ARC(Animal Rescue Community)

## Raising Hands For Injured Paws

Animal Rescue Community (ARC) Pune is a group of college students raising hands for injured paws since 2020. We are a non-profit community organization of around 60 active volunteers, and many passive volunteers all over pune. 

Feeding, Rescue and Adoptions are our main domain of work. Our volunteers daily feed 500+ dogs and cats in their respective areas. Adoption is our prominent feature. We have been a part of 225+ successful adoptions till date. We also take rescue cases enthusiastically.

We believe in coexistence and work for reducing human-animal conflicts.
